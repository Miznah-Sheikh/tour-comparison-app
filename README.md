# Tour Comparison App

This is a simple React app I built to compare travel tours in a clean and user-friendly way.  
It allows users to view different tours, expand their descriptions, and remove any tours they're not interested in.

It was a great way to practice working with `useState`, `useEffect`, passing props, conditional rendering, and managing components in React.



 What This App Can Do

- Loads tour data from a local JSON file using `useEffect`
- Displays each tour as a card with:
  - An image
  - Name and price
  - Expandable "Read More" or "Show Less" description
  - A "Not Interested" button to remove tours
- Handles loading and error states smoothly
- Fully responsive layout with custom CSS styling

 Tools and Technologies

- React (with Vite setup)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS for styling
- Local JSON file for mock data
